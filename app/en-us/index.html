                                    The term ‘work-life balance’ has been thrown around since the ‘70s (ADP) to add depth to the experience of juggling work, family, and life. It’s been 50 years since the term was coined, and suffice to say much has changed since then in both work and life. Frankly, we’re overdue for an update.

                                        Many of us strive for the mythical utopia of ‘work-life balance’. But, the truth is that there’s no such thing – and perhaps there never was. Rather than compartmentalizing and dividing time equally between work and life, we should fuel people as whole beings both in and out of the workplace. It’s time to stop drawing lines in the sand, and instead allow work to play its rightfully vital role in our overall wellbeing.

                                        ‘Work-life wellness’ is an attainable state of mind-body wellbeing that’s found at the intersection of life and work. It’s where life experiences in and out of the office interact to the benefit of employee happiness, health, and performance. Now more than ever before, leaders and businesses alike must understand this space and anticipate what’s to come in it.

                            Over the past few years, several coinciding conditions have inspired the global workforce to reflect and redefine what ‘health’ means, and how it plays into more areas of life than ever before.

                            When it comes to keeping employees well, exercise is a powerful tool. Regular exercise has been found to reduce poor mental health days by 40% per year <i>(The Lancet)</i>. And, in addition to keeping your employees feeling their best, making exercise a part of company culture can lead to bottom-line impacts. 75% of employee medical costs are accrued mostly due to preventable conditions <i>(Gallup)</i>. In the spirit of prevention, fitness is an excellent place to start.

                        <p>‘Emotional workouts’ encompass all of the measures and practices people take to care for their mental health, combat negative thoughts, and increase emotional resilience. These include traditional measures, like a seat on the therapist's couch or a meditation practice, but they also encompass so much more.

                            As Gympass explores in this report, wellbeing has become one of the biggest issues in business. Driven by the pandemic, digital overload, and a strong global economy, employees in every role are overworked, burned out, and operating at capacity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Research shows a holistic approach to wellness is just the beginning. A study by Microsoft shows 87% of employees feel highly productive yet only 12% of leaders agree. As our Healthy Organization study shows, managers and HR teams have to design jobs, operating models, and financial goals so people don’t always feel behind. This is the next big thing in Work-Life Wellness. Gympass customers always tell us their wellbeing program has not only become more expansive, but it’s also impacted the organization’s hiring, leadership, and management practices.
                        </p>

                            As you read this report, I encourage you to consider how your leaders can give people space, time, and a voice to stay healthy. Leaders set the example of wellness - let’s make sure they’re part of the solution.

                            Over the past several years, we’ve seen an influx in corporate crises around retention, engagement, and workplace flexibility. These crises are, at their core, linked to a bigger crisis: a crisis of wellbeing. Our research unpacked why employees are not feeling well, and this can’t be overlooked.

                            Employees’ minds, bodies, and overall wellbeing are in a state that we haven’t quite experienced before. But – sudden, significant change creates incredible opportunities to improve systems as a whole.
