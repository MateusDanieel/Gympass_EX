                                    The term ‘work-life balance’ has been thrown around since the ‘70s (ADP) to add depth to the experience of juggling work, family, and life. It’s been 50 years since the term was coined, and suffice to say much has changed since then in both work and life. Frankly, we’re overdue for an update.

                                        Many of us strive for the mythical utopia of ‘work-life balance’. But, the truth is that there’s no such thing – and perhaps there never was. Rather than compartmentalizing and dividing time equally between work and life, we should fuel people as whole beings both in and out of the workplace. It’s time to stop drawing lines in the sand, and instead allow work to play its rightfully vital role in our overall wellbeing.

                                        ‘Work-life wellness’ is an attainable state of mind-body wellbeing that’s found at the intersection of life and work. It’s where life experiences in and out of the office interact to the benefit of employee happiness, health, and performance. Now more than ever before, leaders and businesses alike must understand this space and anticipate what’s to come in it.

                            Over the past few years, several coinciding conditions have inspired the global workforce to reflect and redefine what ‘health’ means, and how it plays into more areas of life than ever before.

                            When it comes to keeping employees well, exercise is a powerful tool. Regular exercise has been found to reduce poor mental health days by 40% per year <i>(The Lancet)</i>. And, in addition to keeping your employees feeling their best, making exercise a part of company culture can lead to bottom-line impacts. 75% of employee medical costs are accrued mostly due to preventable conditions <i>(Gallup)</i>. In the spirit of prevention, fitness is an excellent place to start.

                        <p>In light of employees’ increased focus on their own wellbeing and how it is or isn’t being supported, employees are also looking to their employers for emotional resilience and psychological safety <i>(Harvard Business Review)</i>.</p>

                        <p>
                            Emotional resilience doesn't just happen overnight. From mental strength-building tools to ‘emotional workouts,’ employees will expect their companies to help them develop the emotional resilience they need to thrive in an uncertain and troubled world <i>(TrendWatching)</i>.

                        </h4>

                        <p>‘Emotional workouts’ encompass all of the measures and practices people take to care for their mental health, combat negative thoughts, and increase emotional resilience. These include traditional measures, like a seat on the therapist's couch or a meditation practice, but they also encompass so much more. Digital innovations and apps are breaking down old-school notions of what constitutes mental health by reducing the barriers to tools and resources.</p>

                        <p>
                            Organizations that take a proactive approach to helping employees develop resilience and mental strength will undoubtedly create a healthier and more engaged workforce capable of driving even better business outcomes.
