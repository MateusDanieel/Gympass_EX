                                    The term ‘work-life balance’ has been thrown around since the ‘70s (ADP) to add depth to the experience of juggling work, family, and life. It’s been 50 years since the term was coined, and suffice to say much has changed since then in both work and life. Frankly, we’re overdue for an update.

                                        Many of us strive for the mythical utopia of ‘work-life balance’. But, the truth is that there’s no such thing – and perhaps there never was. Rather than compartmentalizing and dividing time equally between work and life, we should fuel people as whole beings both in and out of the workplace. It’s time to stop drawing lines in the sand, and instead allow work to play its rightfully vital role in our overall wellbeing.

                                        ‘Work-life wellness’ is an attainable state of mind-body wellbeing that’s found at the intersection of life and work. It’s where life experiences in and out of the office interact to the benefit of employee happiness, health, and performance. Now more than ever before, leaders and businesses alike must understand this space and anticipate what’s to come in it.

                            Over the past few years, several coinciding conditions have inspired the global workforce to reflect and redefine what ‘health’ means, and how it plays into more areas of life than ever before. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Last year, Ipsos found that 70% of consumers across 25 markets reported they tend to spend money with brands whose values reflect their own. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This collective mindshift is reflected in the significant rise in employee expectations, with an increasingly non-negotiable need for wellbeing at work.

                            Living during the time of “The Great Resignation,” the prospect of wellbeing at work is a key factor in career decisions, and presents an easy differential for potential employers.
